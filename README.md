# Codespace containers

Here's a list of typical codespace containers for various different
languages/frameworks which aren't supported by the default image.


* [base] - This provides the minimum set of requirements in order for a codespace
  to function but doesn't provide anything else. It's based on debian buster slim.
* [ruby-2.7] - This adds the required codespace dependencies on top of the official [ruby 2.7-slim-buster] image

[base]: ./base/
[ruby-2.7]: ./ruby-2.7/
[ruby 2.7-slim-buster]: https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby
